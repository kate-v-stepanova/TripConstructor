To run the project, you need to do the following steps:
1) Unpack the archive file
2) Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder with the command "cd"
3) Create a directory (for example with the name ".env")
4) Create the virtual environment with the command "virtualenv"
5) Activate virtual environment with "source .env/bin/activate"
6) Install required packages with "pip install -r pip_requirements.txt"
7) To clear the database if exists, run "python manage.py flush"
8) Sychronise Database with command "python manage.py syncdb"
9) Start the server with commend "python manage.py runserver"
10) Access the project with any browser on "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

Step 6 often fails, because the package "Pillow" requires preinstalled library 'python-dev'.
To install: "sudo apt-get install python-dev".
